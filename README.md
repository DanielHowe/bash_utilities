This is a start to some tools used for managing a system in bash shell

# Network utilities
pingtest.s is an executable bash script that enables users to sweep a network to determine if a host exists.  Especially useful if the arp table does not reveal the host IP address, and the router/DHCP tables are unreachable.

To execute script download/pull, open command prompt, locate file and execute as follows:
```bash
chmod +x pingtest.s
./pingtest.s
```
# Processes
basic-shell-utl.sh is an executable bash script with simple process management, enabling a user to see processes from other users and perform kill, etc on those processes.

To execute script download/pull, open command prompt, locate file and execute as follows:
```bash
chmod +x basic-shell-utl.sh
./basic-shell-utl.sh
```
