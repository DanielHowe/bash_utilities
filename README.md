pingtest.s is an executable bash script that enables users to sweep a network to determine if a host exists.  Especially useful if the arp table does not reveal the host IP address, and the router/DHCP tables are unreachable.

To execute script download/pull, open command prompt, locate file and execute.  For example if in the home directory of a user
```bash
~/.pingtest.s
```
